Giftastic - Super Heros

Check it out here: https://jeremyhancock.github.io/giftastic/

This is basically a page that just makes calls to the Giphy API, themed around super heros and comic books. There are preloaded heros. When a button is pushed 10 gifs are displayed as images. When clicked, the gif plays, when clicked again, it stops. Any hero, villian, or words can be entered into the search. A new button will be created and 10 gifs will be displayed when it is pressed.

This was my first time putting all the CSS and JS right into the HTML file.

Used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, and the Giphy API https://developers.giphy.com/
